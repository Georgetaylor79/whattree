            <dd>Something that I really 
                enjoy doing in the spring/summertime. From buying the 
                supplies, treating the soil to planting the things for the 
                garden. Some of my recent crops are tomatoes, kale, corn, and 
                squash.</dd>

            <dd>I have travel throughout the United States. Just recently I
                went overseas and visited Australia.Loved the customs and foods and I plan 
                on visiting back there soon with other family members.</dd>

            <dd>I grew up with a pond in the backyard and it was full of fish. 
                My mother would go back their and catch the fish for dinner. I would season the fish 
                and help cook them. I also enjoy searching for new recipes and cooking
                new items for friends and family.
